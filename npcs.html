    <h1>Initial Plan</h1>
    <p>Our plan is to focus on importing and designing NPCs in-game and starting to work on gameplay mechanics.</p>
    <h1>Review</h1>
    <p>-Imported and coded NPCs, originally had them walking in random locations, meaning they freely roamed around the open world.</p>
    <p>-Worked on giving each NPC their own personalized walking path, eliminating the issue of them unintentionally walking in unwanted places.</p>
