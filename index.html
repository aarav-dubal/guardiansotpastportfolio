            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>Guardians of the Past is a game designed to teach children problem-solving skills
                while incorporating historical education. By reimagining historical figures, 
                the game introduces players to key moments and individuals from history. 
                Each historical figure will include unique facts, and players will be required
                to answer history-related questions to progress, blending fun and learning 
                seamlessly.

            <h2>Project Timeline</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Week 1-3:</strong> Research historical figures, develop character concepts, plan storyline and educational goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Week 4-5:</strong> Get familiar with Unreal Engine, create initial sprites, begin scripting educational dialogue and history-related questions.</li>
                <li><strong>Week 6:</strong> At the beginning of the week all we knew how to do was add things to worlds and we were on a preset world but after this week we were able to add assets into the world and create a mini game. This week we followed a youtube tutorial in order to get a better understanding of Unreal Engine.<a href="https://youtu.be/1XjgLKrb4_M?si=dRjxyyI9ZPCKzxLb" target="_blank">Tutorial Video</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/9qkm4ZUFb8c?si=SZZIPtGO9NOCcTkX" target="_blank">Our Video</a> </li>
                <li><strong>Week 7-8:</strong> Program core mechanics such as player interactions, questions for progression, and battle sequences. Design first level/area of the game, focusing on one historical era. Conduct initial playtesting and gather feedback</li>
                <li><strong>Week 9-12:</strong> Add other regions/time periods if time permits. Refine based on dialogue and test thoroughly to make sure quality is maximized</li>
                <li><strong>End of Semester:</strong> Complete and package the game, focusing on delivering a polished demo.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Level Ideas</h2>
            <h3>For every level/time period, give the new character some sort of weapon or mechanic based on the situation</h3>
            <ul>
                <h3>Ancient Egypt</h3>
                <li><strong>Sneak mode:</strong> Makes enemies unaware of where you are and allows you to sneak up on them.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Have the character try to sneak into a Pharaoh's tomb and steal the treasure inside while also having cutscenes and dialogue about past pharaohs.</li>
                <h3>Fall of Rome</h3>
                <li><strong>Time Stop:</strong> Allows time to freeze or go into slow motion for a short amount of time allowing you to become more powerful.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Have the character attempt to stop the Fall of Rome and keep Rome afloat. We will also have the character meet past leaders.</li>
                <h3>10th Century China</h3>
                <li><strong>Explosives/Smokes</strong>Allows you to place traps in order to help defeat other enemies while smokes will distract enemies and allow you to get away.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>This section will have your character help with the creation of guns and gunpowder in general. We will have them do this in order to take over China.</li>
                <h3>Black Plague</h3>
                <li><strong>Medicine</strong>Through the level you will acquire more medicines which will allow you to gain new magical abilities or heal yourself.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Place them into a level where we have them get specific items in order to create a remedy to cure people from the black plague.</li>
                <h3>1492</h3>
                <li><strong>Mapping/Scouting</strong>This allows you to enter a first person view almost like controlling a drone to fly ahead and see enemies or traps ahead of you.</li>
                <li><strong></strong>Have the person help to build and set up new lands as well as have them have a portion where they have to stay alive and help others on the trip.</li>
