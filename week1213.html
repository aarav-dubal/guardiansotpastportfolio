    <p>These last two weeks, our main focus has been reflecting on the feedback that was given to us based on how our MVP turned out to make improvements. Some of the things that we are improving are giving the game an actual identity, making quizzes more interactive and less like one that a student would take in school, and just making the game more enjoyable to the user. Along with these improvements, we are developing new features that would further complete our game, such as starting dialogue, NPC's in the hub world, and adding more levels for the user. We also plan to remove some features, those being the health bar in the main world and the options tab in the home screen, becuase we feel as if they have no use or no relevance towards the game. Our aim is to finish everything up within the next four weeks or so.</p>
