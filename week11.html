    <p>In the past week and a half, we made the decision to venture away from GotP being a direct combat game, and we chose to focus more on the educational style. For example, Ryan developed a base level with Napoleon. After Napoleon talking about his backstory, the user has to answer 4 questions about what was said, them being his weaponry, the countries he battled, when he died, and his final battle. After answering all 4 questions correctly, the user is returned back to the hub world in Ancient Egypt.</p>
    <p>Some of the main features include: a portal to take you from the hub world to levels such as Napoleon-Era France, multiple choice questions with correct answers that are mandatory to move on to the next one, dialogue, win/lose screen, button that returns user to the hub.</p>

    <p>In this video, Ryan is doing a playthrough of our MVP, basically demonstrating everything that was explained in the text above.</p>

    <p>This video shows our UE code for the project so far</p>
    <p>Some areas in which we could improve is adding more NPC's in the hub world, adding more levels after Napoleon, and just adding more activities to the hub world.</p>
