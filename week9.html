    <h1>Week 9 Initial Plan</h1>
    <p>Our plan for this week is to create an objective for the game to give it some substance to help set up our minimal viable project. As of now, our leading idea to to make an arena tournament fighting game. The main gimmick that we are thinking of is that each indivudual fight will give you a power that relates to some element from Ancient Egyptian culture. For example, getting the powers of Ra (the sun god), could maybe give you fire powers or something relating to the sun. To add to this, we also plan to add other elements in the next few weeks such as a UI/inventory with enemies to fight in-game, adding skins to NPC's, and creating side characters.</p>
    <!--<h1>Week 8 Review</h1>
    <p>Tuesday/Wednesday: Imported and coded NPCs, originally had them walking in random locations, meaning they freely roamed around the open world.</p>
    <p>Thursday/Friday: Worked on giving each NPC their own personalized walking path, eliminating the issue of them unintentionally walking in unwanted places.</p>
