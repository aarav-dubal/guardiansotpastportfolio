       <p>As development reaches a close, we are reflecting on what we have learned through the past semester.</p>
       <h3>Aarav</h3> 
       <p>Throughout the past semester, I have furthered and expanded my HTML coding skills by working on a variety of projects and exercises. I have also learned more effective ways to utilize ChatGPT as a valuable tool for assistance, whether it involves making revamps to existing code, suggesting edits for improvement, or helping me identify, troubleshoot, and fix bugs or errors efficiently. However, there have been times where I have not utilized class time as well as I could have, which has led to the portfolio and overall development being behind at times. Because of this, I have learned how important proper time management is, and I have made actions to try to maximize the time given to me, ensuring consistent progress and meeting criteria during deadlines.</p> 
        <h3>Ryan</h3>
        <p>I have learned how to fluently and confidently use Unreal Engine. I have gained the ability to create new levels from scratch, import and organize assets effectively, design and implement complex functions, and develop interactive gameplay experiences. Additionally, I have built an entire functioning ecosystem within Unreal Engine. Beyond that, I have also learned how to design and program a quiz-style game that incorporates dialogue, player choices, and a series of engaging questions to enhance the gameplay experience.</p>
