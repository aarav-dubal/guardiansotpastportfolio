    <p>As we reach the end of the semester, we have taken action and began the finalization process for GotP. As of 4/22, Ryan is currently developing an Ancient Rome quiz level with Julius Caesar asking the user questions. Aarav has completely redesigned the portfolio, giving it a modern look and getting rid of the dropdown week-based timeline for individual files going over every step in our current development process. Our ideal final presentation will have 3-4 quiz levels with a more complex and interactive overworld.</p>
