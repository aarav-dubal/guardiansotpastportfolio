    <p>This week, one of the main things that we decided to focus on was level design. Ryan downloaded a pack of objects that can be used to make a level that resembles Ancient Egypt. Full explanation in video. To add to this, Aarav made a change to the timeline part of the portfolio. Instead of a short, static timeline, we now have a timeline that we will change as the weeks go on in a dropdown menu. This changed the page drastically from last week. Last week we had a static timeline with nothing interactive. This also made the website more user-friendly and have a better look overall instead of only having one page the weekly pages will be updated to see what we worked on each week with a video to go in-depth on what we worked on in unreal engine.</p>
